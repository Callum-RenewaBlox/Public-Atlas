"""Keep the hosted Streamlit apps awake.

Streamlit Community Cloud puts an app to sleep after ~12 hours without a
viewer. A plain HTTP GET returns 200 (and /_stcore/health returns "ok") even
while the app is asleep, because the Python app only really wakes when a
browser opens its WebSocket session. So we load each app in a real headless
browser: that opens the WebSocket (which resets the inactivity timer) and, if
an app had already nodded off, clicks the "get this app back up" button to
reboot it.

Two things about streamlit.app worth knowing: the sleep screen is rendered by
the host page a moment after load (so we poll for its button rather than look
once), and a running app renders inside an iframe at ``/~/+/`` (so the "is it
up" check looks through every frame for Streamlit's app marker).

The Investor Portal app is visited at its bare URL, without the access key:
its code prompt is a real Streamlit page, so the visit counts as a viewer and
the key never has to live in this public repository.

Exit code is non-zero if any app could not be confirmed running, so the
workflow's failure step opens a GitHub issue.
